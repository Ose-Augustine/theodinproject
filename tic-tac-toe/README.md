This is a simple tic-tac-toe game. It's called Xs and Os where I come from hence the name.

The game assumes that both players are human and as thus as no methods for automated computer play(maybe in future updates). To start the game, players need to instantiate the umpire in the umpire class (no instance variables needed) and also the play class. Once these two classes have been instantiated, run the file in the command line and the game starts immediately.

The game starts by asking three different prompts. The first prompt is for the player's choice(i.e x or o), the second is for the row position on the board and the third is for the column position on the board to insert the players choice. The game is set to run five rounds declaring a winner at the end of each round and an overall winner after the five rounds have been completed.

Some Features in the Classes to take note of:
The umpire has methods to generate the board and check for a winner.
The play class has a populate board method that allows the player to insert play choice and position.
