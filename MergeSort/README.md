## Merge Sort 

This is an algorithm implementing merge sort using recursion. The function takes in an array arguement of any length and follows merge sort by breaking down into smaller arrays until it reaches the base case i.e 
```return array if array.length < 2```

It is a form of sorting algorithm just like the bubble sort and selection sort.
